                <h2>Form and Function Merch Design</h2>
                <p>Form and function is a student-run, pro-bono, marketing agency that I am an executive member of and I was entrusted with designing the merch for the next school year. This design is one of many I created to be printed on the back of a black hoodie and worn proudly by our members.
                    While creating this design, I kept in mind what Form and Function stands for: our ability to mold and adapt to whatever is handed our way. Thus the logo looks stretched, shaped and formed, but resilient nonetheless.

This design is one of many I created to printed on the front of the hoodie and worn proudly by our members. For this design
                    we wanted to exude a classy, modern look, rather than a bolder one so I combined the shape of an arch with an iconic collegiate font.

                <h2>Trava Airplane Ticket Iconography</h2>
                <p>Trava is a travel-app start-up that I had the honor of working with last quarter as an analyst in Form and Function and I was assigned a lot of graphic work to create a solid, unified, brand image before their initial launch. This airline ticket is one icon I made out of several for Trava to use on their upcoming social media posts or other content.</p>
