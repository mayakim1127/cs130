            <p id="one">My name is Maya Kim and I am a current 2nd year––soon to be third year––at Northwestern University 
                studying Communication Studes, Statistics, Data Science, and Integrated Marketing Communications. Hy hobbies
                include (but definitely are not limited to) volleyball, guitar, singing, and art and in the future, I would love 
                to learn how to throw pottery on the wheel and get back into playing the piano. I am grateful to have had 
                so much exposure and support to venture into different fields, knowledge, and experiences through 
                the various clubs, classes, and peers I have met along the way. From creating brand guidelines and 
                logos, photography, conducting market research and data analytics, and managing two different teams of 4-5 strategists
                and analysts in two differnet sectors of business, marketing and consulting, I have learned so much 
                throughout my journey both during college and before! One of my greatest passions thus far in college is to make
                my work as meaningful and impactful as possible. Due to this passion, I have worked tirelessly over the past year
                creating marketing strategy and deliverables for start-ups and local businesses as well as consulting for non-profit 
                organizations through Form and Function and Rem and Company respectively. My work has been recongized by my peers trust in
                me to lead teams in these respective agencies and companies to continue making a positive impact on this world. 
                This portfolio is essentially an archive of my past work to look back on both my successes, failures, strengths, and
                areas of improvement!
                <p id="two">  
                My main experience and leadership roles in my collegiate career consists of the following:
                - Form and Function Account Executive, Analyst, and Communication Committee member
                - Rem and Company Consulting Team Lead
                - Research Assistant
                - Supervisor for Northwestern Athletics and Recreation
                </p>
