            <p>My name is Maya Kim and I am a current 2nd year––soon to be third year––at Northwestern University 
                studying Communication Studes, Statistics, Data Science, and Integrated Marketing Communications. Hy hobbies
                include (but definitely are not limited to) volleyball, guitar, singing, and art and in the future, I would love 
                to learn how to throw pottery on the wheel and get back into playing the piano. I am grateful to have had 
                so much exposure and support to venture into different fields, knowledge, and experiences through 
                the various clubs, classes, and peers I have met along the way. From creating brand guidelines and 
                logos, conducting market research and data analytics, and managing two different teams of 4-5 strategists
                and analysts in two differnet sectors of business, marketing and consulting, I have learned so much 
                throughout my journey both during college and before! This portfolio is essentially an archive of my past 
                work to look back on both my successes and failures.
